# TODO

- [ ] Implement `view` subcommand with pretty printing.
- [ ] Support `-` as a filename specifying `stdin` like csvkit does.
- [ ] Support other delimiters (not just `,`) for both reading and writing.
- [ ] Implement filtering by numeric types.
- [ ] Add subcommand autocomplete (for `zshell` at least).
